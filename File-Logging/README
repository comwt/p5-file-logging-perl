File-Logging


This module was designed to provide a powerful, yet easy to use interface for logging.


Key Features:

> Object Oriented to keep your programs and namespace clean
> Automatic file locking and unlocking
> Ability to auto-truncate files, write to screen, log or both, log process ids
> Multiple debug levels supported
> Support for alternate log files (i.e. server, client, default)
> Built in help
> Supports the following log types: alert, crit, debug, emerg (emergency), error, fatal, info, log, normal, notice, success and warn
> Colorized output


You don't even have to define your log names/paths to use it. The simplest invocation is, as follows:

use File::Logging;
my $i = File::Logging->new();
$i->info( "-print", "Hello!" );


If your script is named "hello.pl" it will create a log file named "hello.pl.log" in your current directory.

Full disclosure is included in the Synopsys.
